I'm going to spend a few hours implementing the proxy service that Mark Smith (@zorkian) covered on the talk that he gave at linux.conf.au 2015. Thanks Mark, you did an excellent job!

While I'm writing this I'm wondering what Linus Torvalds thinks about Go. I'm going to guess that he hates it.

Do not use this, just in case.
